SVG Reader
---

## Task

 1. Read and Analyze SVG File:

- The program needs to read the SVG file and analyze its structure.
- It should handle different components and attributes of SVG, as well as the hierarchical structure of the elements.

 2. Display Graphics:

- There must be a rendering engine to draw vector graphics based on the data analyzed from the SVG file.
- It must support displaying basic shapes, text, strokes, and fills.

 3. Interaction (Optional):

- Features for zooming and rotating objects.

 4. Object-Oriented Design:

- Create a class hierarchy to represent different SVG components.
- Utilize object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

 5. Documentation:

- Provide detailed documentation on class structures, methods, and functions.
- Include UML diagrams to illustrate relationships between classes in the rendering module.

## Proposed Steps for Implementation

 1. Project Structure:

- Create basic classes for SVG components such as Circle, Path, and Text.
- Create an SVGParser class to handle reading and analyzing the SVG file.

 2. Graphics Rendering:

- Use a graphics library that supports Unix operating systems, such as Cairo or OpenGL, to draw the parsed SVG objects.

 3. Interaction:

- Add an InteractionHandler class to manage zooming and rotating interactions.

 4. Documentation and UML Diagram:

- Use a tool like PlantUML to create UML diagrams for classes and their relationships.
